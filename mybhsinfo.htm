<h1>Our Objectives</h1>
<ul>
    <li>To preserve the history of Billinge for present and future
        generations.</li>
    <li>To promote interest in the history of Billinge.</li>
    <li>To publish the history of Billinge in printed and electronic
        formats so that interested parties have easy and unrestricted access to it.</li>
</ul>

<p>We hold open public meetings on the first Tuesday of
    the month - all welcome.</p>
<p>If you have any old Billinge photos <u>please</u> let
    us scan them for posterity. We have saved over 300 historic photos to
    date - view them in the galleries. We can e-mail you high resolution versions
    of any of these photos if you want to print them. Perhaps you can come
    to a meeting sometime.</p>
