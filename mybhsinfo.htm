    <h1>Our Objectives</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>To preserve the history of Billinge for present and future
        generations.</li>
      <li>To promote interest in the history of Billinge. </li>
      <li>To publish the history of Billinge in printed and electronic
        formats so that interested parties have easy and unrestricted access to it.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We hold open public meetings on the first Tuesday of
        the month - all welcome.</p>
    <p>If you have any old Billinge photos <u>please</u> let
        us scan them for posterity. We have saved over 300 historic photos to 
        date - view them in the galleries. We can e-mail you high resolution versions 
        of any of these photos if you want to print them. Perhaps you can come 
        to a meeting sometime.</p>
