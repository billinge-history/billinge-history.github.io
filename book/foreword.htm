<p>The objectives of</p>
<h1>Billinge History Society</h1>
<p>as stated in its constitution, are</p>
<ul>
<li>To investigate, compile, preserve and present the History of Billinge for the education and gratification of present
    and future generations of the village, its surrounding municipalities and beyond.</li>
<li>To promote interest in and maintain appreciation of the History of Billinge, its buildings and immediate environment,
    by whatever means are within the capabilities of the Billinge History Society.</li>
<li>To publish the History of Billinge in printed and electronic formats so that all and any interested parties have easy
    and unrestricted access to it. </li>
</ul>
<p>*</p>
<p>This book is an attempt to abide by those objectives.  It has been a huge community effort.  Seven people donated the
    bulk of the written text; several others have also made written contributions, as the many the appendixes clearly
    demonstrate.</p>
<p>The photographs that illustrate this book all have their origins with Billinge families.  We thank everyone who has
    donated photographs for making them available.  So far we have over one thousand preserved for future
    generations.</p>
<p>Most of the information in this book was obtained from the older generation who still retain it.  We are indebted to
    those who had the patience to speak to us and pass on their knowledge.  Mrs Ethel Smith has played the major role in
    this regard.  Without her, much of what is here recorded would have been lost forever.</p>
<p>All the written text and a great many more photographs than are contained in this book, can be viewed and downloaded
    from our website at <a href="https://billinge-history.github.io">billinge-history.github.io</a>.</p>
<p>This is the third edition of the work of Billinge History Society.  We are entirely dependent on input from the local
    community.  If you have documents relating to Billing History, any written family history or photographs, please
    consider briefly loaning them so they can be preserved and included and in any subsequent edition.</p>
<p>We possess audio equipment to record oral history.  The Billinge accent is well worth preserving.  If you know anyone
    willing to tell the tale, please get it touch.</p>
<p>This book will undoubtedly contain mistakes.  We hope those reading it will be able to point them out.  Any
    suggestions for improvement are more than welcome.</p>
