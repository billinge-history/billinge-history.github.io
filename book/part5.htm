<h2 id="king">FOR KING AND COUNTRY</h2>
<p>It must have been around November 1999 that my mother gave me a tiny slip of paper on which was typed a request for information about Billinge men killed in both World Wars.  The name on the bottom of the slip was Harry Roughley.  I thought it unlikely that this person was a relation of Jimmy Roughley, the legendary ‘Owd Ruff’ of Holt Crescent and so it turned out to be.  Thirty years of living in Billinge could not disguise the St Helens accent when Harry Roughley answered the phone.</p>
<p>After single-handedly compiling the registries of St Mary’s Birchley and leaving copies at both St Helens and Wigan Reference Libraries, Harry had undertaken to gather and record information about all the names mentioned as having Billinge connections on the commemoration plaques and gravestones throughout the area.  That is an enormous task for a lone researcher.  He had gone through every Church Magazine deposited in the Leigh Archives and every local newspaper recorded on microfilm at both Wigan and St Helens Reference Libraries.  His intention was to gather relevant information, a photograph and a picture of the regimental cap badge of every person killed in action, connected to Billinge, from two World Wars.  A large percent of the information he was searching for proved easy to obtain.  A small percent proved almost impossible.  Feeling that my parents knew, or would know somebody who did know, everybody who died in the Second World War and the remaining families of those who perished in the First World War, I undertook to help Harry trace the names that were proving elusive.  Some we found and some we didn’t.  The quest was interesting and very fulfilling.  I’m too young to remember even the Second World War but I do remember the derelict bombsites as the train pulled into Liverpool when I was a kid.  Just a few weeks ago I came upon this poem, embossed on a bronze plaque, fastened to a stone by a deserted airfield near Fiskerton.</p>
<p>Listen to the Wind.</p>
<p>Stranger, pause here a little while,</p>
<p>And listen to the West wind’s sigh,</p>
<p>With its tale of long gone men - </p>
<p>Earth shall not see their likes again.</p>
<p>Stand by this stone and lend an ear,</p>
<p>And I’ll show you ghosts of yesteryear;</p>
<p>The windsock’s crack, the cold wind’s moan,</p>
<p>Long dead men crowd around – we’re not alone.</p>
<p>Look at this empty, lonely place,</p>
<p>Do their shadows unseen still cross my face?</p>
<p>Listen! Far off thunder – or a Merlin’s roar,</p>
<p>Borne on the wind from time’s remote shore.</p>
<p>Abandoned, quiet, here I lie,</p>
<p>Time stands still, though years roll by;</p>
<p>Runways broken, dispersals gone,</p>
<p>The only sound the skylark’s song.</p>
<p>Half a hundred years have passed,</p>
<p>Half a century since I saw them last;</p>
<p>Lancasters, black against the sky;</p>
<p>Aircrews young, so many soon to die.</p>
<p>They came from England and from distant shores,</p>
<p>Volunteers, each one, to defend liberty’s cause;</p>
<p>These fractured runways know how many went,</p>
<p>Silent witnesses to Youth’s blood spent.</p>
<p>I was created from the very earth for which they fought,</p>
<p>My rich, dark soil, with their sacrifice they bought;</p>
<p>In Lincoln Cathedral, yonder, their names are found,</p>
<p>And know this, by their blood you stand on hallowed ground.</p>
<p>Let the tangled weeds that cover me remain,</p>
<p>Shrouding my memories of hope and pain;</p>
<p>And, as I return slowly to land</p>
<p>Let this precious stone in perpetual homage stand.</p>
<p>So Stranger, continue now upon your way,</p>
<p>But forget not those who – it seems but yesterday</p>
<p>Gave their tomorrows that you might live,</p>
<p>For your freedom they gave all they had to give.</p>
<p>Cedric Keith St George Roberts.  May 1995.  </p>
<p>Dedicated to the Aircrews of 576 Squadron, No I Group, R.A.F. Bomber Command, who operated Lancaster Bombers from Fiskerton between October 1944 and May 1945, so many never to return.</p>
<p>Reading these words made me think of my Uncle Bill and George Kearsley dive-bombing Chadwick Green as trainee pilots in 1940.  It made me think again about my Uncle Stanley Williams on the Murmansk convoys and my Uncle Ernie Lee on mopping-up operations in the Pacific.  It made me remember Betty Atherton running back to Holt Crescent from Carr Mill Road, terrified when a couple of stray bombs landed in the field near Long Fold Brow.  It made me think about Harry Roughley and what he was doing to perpetuate the names of those from Billinge who gave their lives for King and country.  It will not be long before there is not a single living person who can remember ever seeing someone who died in the Second World War.  Below is the text that Harry as so far amalgamated – lest we forget.  </p>
