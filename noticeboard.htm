      <h1>Notice board</h1>
      <p>If you want anything inserting in this Notice Board
        just <a href="https://github.com/billinge-history/billinge-history.github.io/issues">create an issue</a></p>
      <p>There are about 1000 pictures in this site, all in small resolution. 
        If you want larger versions of any of them, suitable for printing, create an issue
        and we'll send them to you.</p>
      <p>We need to save your old photos here, where they will always be available
        for coming generations - they are no use under the bed in a box. We can 
        come to you to scan them or bring them to the meetings. We can record 
        on mini-disk anyone who can talk about how Billinge used to be. Please 
        make contributions to this site by contacting us.</p>
      <p>Please download the written text and read through it at your leisure. 
        Send any corrections or suggestions on how it can be improved. The latest 
        edition was uploaded March 2004 If you have an earlier version, replace 
        it with this one. It now consists of nine parts. Part 7 is about Billinge 
        Chairs and Aidans Church. Part 8 is an important new study relating to 
        the Billinge family and early Billinge history.</p>
      <p>Please speak to your old relatives and write down all you can - once 
        they are gone it's too late. Send anything at all about your family history 
        so that we can incorporate it into the written text. Create an issue for help
        or advice.</p>
      <p>History Society meetings are at the Labor Club on the first Tuesday 
        of the month from September to June. Everyone is more than welcome to 
        attend.</p>
