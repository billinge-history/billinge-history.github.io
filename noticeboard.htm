    - many thanks Dave Whitmore.</p>
<p>We can send you a CD with all our photographs (about 1000) in 300 ppi and the written
    text of the book. You could then format high quality photo pages as you decide,
    insert them wherever you choose, and get the book bound yourself. We hope to
    upload the book with all the photo pages included some time in the future.</p>
<p>You can contact us.
    <a href="https://github.com/billinge-history/billinge-history.github.io/issues">Create an issue</a>
    if you have any inquiries or want anything inserting in this Notice Board.</p>
<p>There are about 1000 pictures in this site, all in small resolution.
    If you want larger versions of any of them, suitable for printing, create an issue
    and we'll send them to you.</p>
<p>We need to save your old photos here, where they will always be available
    for coming generations - they are no use under the bed in a box. We can
    come to you to scan them or bring them to the meetings. We can record
    on mini-disk anyone who can talk about how Billinge used to be. Please
    make contributions to this site by contacting us.</p>
<p>Please download the written text and read through it at your leisure.
    Send any corrections or suggestions on how it can be improved. The latest
    edition was uploaded March 2004 If you have an earlier version, replace
    it with this one. It now consists of nine parts. Part 7 is about Billinge
    Chairs and Aidans Church. Part 8 is an important new study relating to
    the Billinge family and early Billinge history.</p>
<p>Please speak to your old relatives and write down all you can - once
    they are gone it's too late. Send anything at all about your family history
    so that we can incorporate it into the written text. Create an issue for help
    or advice.</p>
<p>History Society meetings are at the Labor Club on the first Tuesday
    of the month from September to June. Everyone is more than welcome to
    attend.</p>
