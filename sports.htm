<p>We don't know the person 5th from the left in the front row. Taken 1928-1929</p>

<p>Many of these Billingers in this photo taken in 1918 would have
    served in the First World War.<br>
    <a href="book">The main text</a> contains every Billinge
    person killed in action in both World Wars.</p>

<p>Some of those featured in these two photos are still
    around to tell the tale. If you have any sporting photos that are not
    included in this web site, please contact us so that we can scan and
    save them.</p>

<p>Who's in the middle of the back row, the right of the front row or that kid in front?</p>

<p>The last Billinge team before the ground was used for
    housing. They won the league that year. Who is that kid sat in front?</p>

<p>These are just a few of the photos that we have and
