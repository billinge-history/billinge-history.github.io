<h2>Our Nell‚Äôs Jack üèÜ</h2>
<p>On December 28th, 1879, a Billinge lad, John Hill, better known as ‚ÄòOur Nell‚Äôs Jack‚Äô,
    beat Fish Smart, the speed skating champion of England over 400 yards on Carr Mill Dam.
    Billinge, for the first and only time in its history, had a Champion of England.
    The song, composed about this feat and was sung at local gatherings for years.
