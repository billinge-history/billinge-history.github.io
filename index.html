<hr>

<p>Billinge was founded around 550 AD by an Angle tribe, the Varini, whose leading clan, the Billingas, gave
    the
    village and its first ruling family their names. Billinge retained its Anglo Saxon name and culture
    throughout the
    subsequent invasion and settlement by the Norsemen, 700 - 800. Around 1290, the Manor of Billinge
    divided
    into four. The ancient manor houses of Billinge, Birchley, Bispham and Winstanley are still standing.
    Billinge
    remained a comparatively isolated community for centuries, until the coal boom and the rise of Wigan and
    St
    Helens as industrial centres during the Industrial Revolution.</p>
<p>Stone was mined in Billinge as far back as the 11th century.
    The manor houses, churches, schools, farm buildings, pubs
    and houses were all built from locally quarried stone.
<p>After the auction of the Winstanley Estate to meet death duties
    in 1951, Billinge Council allowed new housing estates to be
    built and many old stone buildings were abandoned,
    condemned or demolished. The character of the village is
    changing by new development.</p>
