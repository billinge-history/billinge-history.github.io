    - many thanks Dave Whitmore.</p>
<p>We can send you a CD with all our photographs (about 1000) in 300 ppi and the written
    text of the book. You could then format high quality photo pages as you decide,
    insert them wherever you choose, and get the book bound yourself. We hope to
    upload the book with all the photo pages included some time in the future.</p>
<p>You can contact us.
