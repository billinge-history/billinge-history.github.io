<p>Announcements:</p>
<p>Our essay competition was announced in the last edition of Past Forward; entries 
  need to be in by 12th October to pastforward@wlct.org</p>
<p>The Boer War Memorial will be unveiled when restoration of Mesnes Park is completed 
  sometime in 2013.</p>
<p>At the recent Heritage Open Days attendance was disappointing. Next year's 
  to be reviewed.</p>
<p>Presentation by Orrell/Billinge Transition Group:</p>
<p>Mandy Wellens-Bray &amp; Kath Godfrey outlined the history and philosophy behind 
  the transition town movement - a grassroots network of communities working to 
  build resilience in response to peak oil, climate destruction, and economic 
  instability.</p>
<p>An entertaining six-minute video outlined the problems we face in the near 
  future as our current dependency on fossil fuels becomes unsustainable. The 
  production of food locally will grow in importance as the cost of transporting 
  food from overseas becomes increasingly expensive due to rising fuel costs as 
  reserves of oil become depleted. The climatic changes due to global warming 
  and the seemingly ongoing economic instability will necessitate a change of 
  lifestyle. The transition town movement is about communities realising the lifestyle 
  changes that will have to be made and being in a position to adapt to them.</p>
<p>The Orrell/Billinge Transition Group is negotiating to take over a seven-hectare 
  farm near Orrell Water Park and develop it into a community farm project that 
  will produce sustainable, organically grown produce for the local community. 
  It is envisioned that this project will serve as an example for the rest of 
  the borough and members of the group are willing to give presentations to E&amp;H 
  Network members groups. Contact Mandy on wellensbray@btinternet.com</p>
<p>Greenheart Update:</p>
<p>Martin Purcell informed the meeting that the consultation exercise for Lightshaw 
  Meadows had been completed; Leisure &amp; Culture Trust are looking for a commercial 
  developer to maybe transform Haigh Hall into a hotel; a 'friends of' group has 
  been established for Kirkless; Greenheart is working in conjunction with the 
  PCT regarding health issues for the borough and the Town Centre Project is progressing.</p>
<p><br>
  Minutes of the last meeting: true and accurate</p>
<p>Matters Arising: </p>
<p>There was some discussion regarding amendments proposed to the Local Development 
  Framework by Central Government concerning land for housing development throughout 
  the borough. Submissions close 12 September.</p>
<p>Dave Wilson commented that parts of the greenbelt are actually in private hands 
  and neither accessible to the public or of much use to wildlife due to agricultural 
  use. </p>
<p>Celebration Evening:</p>
<p>This will be held on the evening of November 1st at the Museum of Wigan Life. 
  The room is booked and refreshments have been ordered. Awards will be presented 
  to the winners of the essay competition and to groups and individuals who have 
  contributed to the borough's local environments and heritage.</p>
