    <h1>FARRAR</h1>
    <p><small>by Maureen McManus (extracted from Appendix T in
            <a href="../book">the main text</a>)</small></p>
    <p>Tracing my Family History was, for many years, something
        that I promised myself I would do 'one day '. I think I was deterred somewhat
        by warnings that, as a hobby, it was very addictive and time consuming and
        also by the family folk-lore stories that all of my great-grandparents came
        from Ireland and therefore records would be unavailable or even non-existent.
        I used to dream of tracing a family of "olde English yeomen " with roots going
        back two or three hundred years. Early retirement was the chance to indulge
        myself. My starting point was my father's parents, married in St. Helens in
        1904. I had never known my grandmother, Elizabeth Farrar, nor any of her family
        as she had died in 1925 when my father was 12 years old. I was surprised to
        discover that she had been born in 1879 in Chadwick Green, Billinge, a place
        that I had heard of but knew nothing about. The 1881 Census gave me the address
        Brown Heath Nook and details of the family; parents Thomas and Elizabeth and
        seven children, Elizabeth being the youngest. Some time soon after that, I
        found myself one Sunday afternoon with nothing planned and decided to visit
        Billinge. I don't know what I was expecting to discover. I drove through the
        village and noticed St. Mary's Church, Birchley. It looked old enough to have
        been there in Elizabeth Farrar's time so I stopped to look around. I noticed
        many people walking round behind the building and followed them. I arrived
        at the doors of the Parish Hall on which was a notice announcing an exhibition
        of Parish History! </p>
    <p>Inside, the Hall was crowded with people and displays of
        all types. I soon realised that I hadn't time to read everything. Noticing
        a table with two ladies selling booklets I asked if there was one about the
        exhibition. They pointed to a man at a table in the middle of the room and
        said he was the one to answer that question. It turned out that he was responsible
        for staging the whole event and was just looking forward to it being over
        so that he could get his life back. He asked about my interest in the exhibition
        and couldn't believe that I had arrived that day just by chance. I explained
        that I knew nothing about Elizabeth Farrar, her family nor of any connection
        with St. Mary's. He then introduced me to several people in the room who were
        from old Billinge families and might be able to help me. One lady told me
        that the reason for the exhibition that weekend was that the original Church
        Bell was going to be re-hung in the restored bell tower and that the bell
        was on display in the Church. If Elizabeth had lived in Billinge, she would
        have grown up hearing that bell. I decided to go across to the Church to see
        it. Walking across the Hall I had to pass a pillar with part of a display
        on it. The names on one of the notices seemed to jump out at me. They were
        a Farrar family with the same Christian names I remembered from Elizabeth's
        family; Ralph, Thomas, James, Francis, Ann and Elizabeth. The list was the
        Papist Return for 1767 in Billinge. I knew then that I was meant to be there
        but I didn't know then that my dream was about to come true. </p>
