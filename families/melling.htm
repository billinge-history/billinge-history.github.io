<h1>MELLING</h1>
<p><small>(from Appendix K in <a href="../book">the main text</a>)</small></p>
<p>(note. We really could do with some help in sorting out the many different
  branches of the Melling family)</p>
<p>There exists a record of Richard and Betty Melling, born in the late 1760's
  and married in the late 1780's. I think that they were the parents of Thomas 
  and possibly John Melling.</p>
<p> Thomas Melling (1st July 1804 - 4th March 1854) married a woman called Margaret
  who died 20th November 1883. They appear to have had five children; a boy, Richard 
  1838-1887, and four girls, Elizabeth, born 1828, Margaret, born 1833, Mary, 
  born 1841 and Lydia, born 1850. </p>
<p>Elizabeth may never have married but there is a grandchild, Thomas Melling,
  mentioned in the 1861 census that may have been her illegitimate child. </p>
<p>Margaret's husband's surname was Ashall and their three boys were christened
  John, James and Thomas.</p>
<p> Mary's husband was Robert Ormeshire. Her son Robert married Elizabeth Melling,
  discussed below, and their children were Alice and Edward. </p>
<p>Lydia married William Robinson and together they made the long journey from
  Longshaw Common to Chadwick Green and gave this work its title. Their lives 
  of their four children, two boys and two girls, are dealt with in the main body 
  of this text. When Lydia came to Chadwick Green, three Melling children came 
  with her, Harry, Thomas and Elizabeth. Harry Melling became the father of eight 
  girls, a crippled son who died at the age of eleven and a son, Tom, who worked 
  at Hitchen's Farm in Carr Mill Road for fifty-four years. Who the parents of 
  these three children were is unclear at this stage. Their father may have been 
  the grandchild Thomas, mentioned in the 1861 census and probably the son of 
  Elizabeth, making Lydia their aunt. What is known is that the younger Elizabeth 
  Melling, whoever her parents were, married Robert Ormeshire, the son of Lydia's 
  sister Mary. </p>
<p>Richard's wife's christian name was Sarah (1842-1892). Her maiden name may
  have been Melling also. She appears to be the daughter of John Melling and Ellen 
  nee Holland who lived at the Hare and Hounds. They were, I think, the proprietors 
  of the Hare and Hounds at the bottom of Longshaw Old Road, before it was rebuilt 
  by their grandson, John Thomas Melling (1864-1925), in 1907. John and Ellen 
  had daughters named Sarah and Margaret and it could be that John was the brother 
  of Thomas (1804-1854), making Richard and Sarah cousins. </p>
<p>Richard and Sarah had five children, John Thomas (1864-12/10/1925), who became
  a builder, Margaret, Ellen, Elizabeth Ann and Richard. </p>
<p>Margaret's husband, John Thomas Heaton was the landlord of the Queen's Arms
  in Sandbrook Rd, Orrell now known as Sandbrook Arms. Richard and Sarah's other 
  daughters, Ellen and Elizabeth Ann, married the brothers of John Thomas Heaton 
  - three sisters thereby marrying three brothers. Ellen married Henry and they 
  became the first proprietors of the new Hare and Hounds. Elizabeth Ann married 
  Fred Heaton, a miner. </p>
<p>Richard Melling was the father of Cyril, Ken and Winifred Melling. Ken Melling
  ran the garage in UpHolland Road, across from the Unicorn and is featured in 
  'One Man's Pitch' by David Young.</p>
<p> John Thomas Melling (1864-1925) built many of the houses in and around Longshaw.
  He and his sisters and brother lived in the old Hare and Hounds in Longshaw, 
  later building the new Hare and Hounds around 1907. John Thomas' two sons Richard 
  (1891) and Francis (1893) carried on the building firm known as J.T Melling 
  & Sons. His daughter Ellen (1895) married William Atherton and they became the 
  proprietors of the Eagle and Child on Church Brow. As this couple had no children 
  they are not the parents of Irvine Atherton who was subsequently landlord of 
  the same pub. Jane Atherton, sister of William Atherton, married Joseph Tinsley 
  from Otterswift Farm. They lost two girls at birth and helped run the Eagle 
  and Child for about 10 years. When William married Ellen Melling, Joe Tinsley 
  went back to farming for a while then married again to Clara Edwards from Tarbuck 
  House. They subsequently moved to Brownheath House and there were no kids by 
  this marriage. </p>
<p>Francis Melling married Catherine Smith from Plane Tree Farm, Crank Road, and
  had one son, John, who died in 1979. </p>
<p>Richard Melling married Maggie Bradley from Sutches Farm, UpHolland and had
  two children, Elizabeth Anne and William. William married to Ethel Hitchmough 
  and left 4 sons: Stephen, Andrew, John and Anthony when he died in 1973. </p>
<p>Elizabeth married Leslie Houghton in 1949 and had two children. Anne born 1952
  married Ian Gaskell and has two daughters, Amy and Alison. David, born1955, 
  married Lynn Sherrif. They have a son Gareth and daughter Bethany. </p>
