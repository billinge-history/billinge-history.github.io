<h1>FOSTER</h1>
<p><small> By Alan Foster (from Appendix J in <a href="../book">the main text</a>)</small></p>
<p>William was the second child of Henry & Jane FOSTER, born and baptised in
  1816 at Weedon Barracks, Northamptonshire, during his father's tenure in the 
  Royal Regiment of Artillery. His trade was that of a weaver. In 1839, at the 
  age of 23 years, he married Catherine GASKELL in Billinge and had a son named 
  Thomas. In June 26th, 1841, he was charged and arrested for Highway Robbery 
  and Stealing then incarcerated at Kirkdale Jail awaiting trial. The offense 
  was committed at Windle, St Helens, together with two other accomplices, namely 
  John BIRCHALL aged 19 and William LIPTROT aged 23. At the trial, on July 15, 
  1841, at Kirkdale, William and his two accomplices were found guilty and sentenced 
  to ten years, to be served in Van Dieman's Land (Tasmania). They were transported 
  aboard the 549 ton Barque the "John Brewer" sailing out of Sheerness on December 
  5, 1841, via Teneriffe and arriving at Hobart, Van Dieman's Land, on April 6, 
  1842. </p>
<p>During his stay in Van Dieman's Land he was housed in a camp called Finders
  Bay Station, now known as Taranna. While there, he made three applications to 
  marry Sarah Pring 1844, Hannah Osborne 1848 and Maria Hopkins 1849. All these 
  girls were convicts. He decided on the latter and married Maria Hpokins on May 
  14, 1849 at the Bothwell United Church, Van Diemans's Land. At the end of their 
  sentences, in 1851, they returned to the UK and settled in Billinge, William's 
  hometown, where they lived at Gorsey Brow. Maria died in 1865 at the age of 
  46 of an Abdominal Tumor. Not wanting to waste any time, William found another 
  wife (# 3) by the name of Martha CUNLIFFE and they where married October 23, 
  1866. They had two children, Sarah and William. Martha died in 1883 at the age 
  of 49 of Phthisis. William lived alone for the rest of his life and died in 
  1891 at the age of 75 years.</p>
