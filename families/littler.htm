<p>There exists a record of Richard and Betty Melling, born in the late 1760's
  and married in the late 1780's. I think that they were the parents of Thomas 
  and possibly John Melling. Thomas Melling (1st July 1804 - 4th March 1854) married 
  a woman called Margaret who died 20th November 1883. They appear to have had 
  five children, a boy, Richard 1838-1887, and four girls, Elizabeth, born 1828, 
  Margaret, born 1833, Mary, born 1841 and Lydia, born 1850. Elizabeth may never 
  have married but there is a grandchild, Thomas Melling, mentioned in the 1861 
  census that may have been her child. Margaret's husband's surname was named 
  Ashall and their three boys were christened John, James and Thomas. Mary's husband 
  was Robert Ormeshire, their children Alice and Edward. Lydia married William 
  Robinson and together they made the long journey from Longshaw Common to Chadwick 
  Green and gave this work its title. Their lives of their four children, two 
  boys and two girls, are dealt with in the main body of this text. Richard's 
  wife's christian name was Sarah and their five children were John Thomas (1864-12/10/1925), 
  who became a butcher, Margaret, Ellen, Elizabeth Ann and Richard. Of Richard 
  and Sarah's three daughters I know nothing but one of their sons, Richard, was 
  the father of Cyril, Ken and Winifred Melling. Ken Melling ran the garage in 
  UpHolland Road, across from the Unicorn and is featured in 'One Man's Pitch' 
  by David Young. Richard and Sarah's other son, John Thomas (1864-1925), had 
  two sons, Richard (born 1891) and Francis (born 1893) and a daughter, Ellen 
  (born 1895). Ellen married William Atherton and they were the proprietors of 
  the Eagle and Child on Church Brow. As this couple had no children they are 
  not the parents of Irvine Atherton who was subsequently landlord of the same 
  pub. The maiden name of Sarah (1842-1892), wife of Richard Melling (1838-1887), 
  may have been Melling also. She appears to be the daughter of John Melling and 
  Ellen nee Holland who lived at the Hare and Hounds. They were, I think, the 
  proprietors of the Hare and Hounds when it was still at the bottom of Longshaw 
  Old Road, before the present pub was built in 1907. They had daughters named 
  Sarah and Margaret and it could be that John was the brother of Thomas (1804-1854), 
making Richard and Sarah cousins. </p>
