    <h1>TAYLOR</h1>
    <p><small>(extracted from <a href="../book">the main text</a>)</small></p>
    <p>Some two hundred years ago, <b>Edward</b> Taylor married a girl called Hester.
        They were my great, great, great, great grandparents, presumably born around
        1769, the year James Watt's patented the steam engine. The days of England's
        predominately agricultural economy were numbered. The Industrial Revolutions
        was on its way. The appalling poverty and degradation into which the working
        class of rural Lancashire would be plunged didn't become apparent until the
        publication of the Children's Employment Commission of 1842. The record says
        that their wedding took place in Winstanley but where in Winstanley I cannot
        imagine. Their dates of birth and Hester's maiden name are unknown to me at
        present, perhaps they always will be. Records only go back so far and then become
        hazy. The parents of this couple may well have witnessed Bonnie Prince Charlie,
        the Young Pretender, march by their homes at the head of the last Jacobite army
        in December 1745. They may even have been sympathetic, after all they were Catholic
        at a time when there weren't many Catholics in the area. Years of religious
        persecution had seen to that. In 1717 only ten out of one hundred and ninety-eight
        families in Billinge were listed as being Papist. Unfortunately for Catholic
        supporters, the Highlanders grew afraid in unfamiliar flat terrain as they ran
        out of hills in the Midlands. With the English armies overseas and London there
        for the taking, they turned back to face ultimate disaster at Culloden in 1746.
        England remained Protestant. In the backlash of that near catastrophe, Catholic
        persecution intensified domestically and terror was unleashed against the Scottish
        Highlanders. It may have been some small consolation that Protestant England
        had to finally concede to Pope Gregory's reformed calendar of 1558 by dropping
        the eleven days from September 3 -13 in 1752. Catholic emancipation would not
        happen until 1829. </p>
    <p><b>Edward</b> and Hester Taylor's children included <b>William</b>, born 14th
        December, in the dreadful winter of 1794, as England's troops fled across the
        frozen wastes of Holland before the ravaging Jacobin army of France, spawned
        by the Revolution, at the outbreak of what would evolve into the Napoleonic
        Wars. The following month, one third of the expiditionary force of 18,000 would
        perish, in four days, as the retreat disintergarated into chaos. Edward was
        the eldest of that large family, the other children being James, John, Margaret,
        Thomas, Henry, Joseph and Peter, the youngest, born 28th October 1811, a year
        in which Luddite disturbances were recorded in Yorkshire - the effects of the
        Industrial Revolution were not pleasing everyone.</p>
    <p>There was no official Catholic Church at Birchley until 1828 so <b>William,
    </b>my great, great , great grandfather, was not married at St. Mary's. I can't
        find a record of the marriage at St. Aidan's either. Maybe he got married at
        Birchley Hall. There had been a clandestine chapel there since 1618. The events
        centred on the Catholic Anderton family's occupation of Birchley Hall, from
        its purchase by Christopher Anderton in 1558 to the death of Sir Francis Anderton
        in 1770, are probably the most historically significant occurrences in Billinge
        history. That recorded history goes back to the Angles settling the area around
        550 AD. The Celts would have been there before the Angles but they left no trace.
        The Roman Road, running north to Hadrian's Wall, ran through Warrington, Wigan
        and Preston. There was also a Roman Road from Manchester to Wigan. The Romans
        mined some iron ore and coal at Orrell but they probably left Billinge alone.
        Who knows what went on in Billinge before the Romans came? Wherever and whenever
        the marriage took place, <b>William</b> Taylor married Joan Fairhurst some time
        around 1820. The village must still have been reeling from news of the nearby
        Peterloo Massacre and George IV had just ascended to the throne. Their second
        child, <b>Esther</b>, born 28th May 1822, was my great, great grandmother .</p>
