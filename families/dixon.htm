<h1>DIXON</h1>
<p><small>By Gerry Rigby (extracted from Appendix O in <a href="../book">the main text</a>)</small></p>
<p>This is the story of the Dixon family, the brothers & sisters of my great
  grandmother Margaret Rowson (formally Margaret Dixon). Margaret Rowson was a 
  child of John & Mary Dixon (formally Mary Rigby) from Brownheath Nook, Chadwick 
  Green, Billinge. The full family of John & Mary Dixon, all born in Brownheath 
  Nook, was:- Margaret, born 1834, married James Harvey Rowson from Eccleston 
  in 1860, died 1910 age 77, buried at Birchley. William, born 1837, married Jane 
  Bone from Winstanley in 1862, died 1907 age 70, buried at Birchley. Simon, born 
  1839 died 1840, exact date of death and burial place unknown. Simon, born 1842, 
  bachelor, died 1866 age 23, buried at Windleshaw. John, born 1845, bachelor, 
  died 1880 age 35, buried at Birchley. George, born 1848, married Ann Witherington 
  from Ashton in 1870, died 1928 age 79, buried at Birchley. Joseph, born 1852, 
  married Margaret Witherington from Haydock in 1873, date of death and burial 
  place unknown. The two Witherington girls above were both daughters of Frederick 
  & Ellen Witherington, (nee Morris). Frederick Witherington was the son of George 
  & Margaret Witherington. The first family (the Rowsons) has been almost fully 
  catalogued, and the last family (Joseph Dixon) has also been fairly well catalogued. 
  However the lives of William & George are very much incomplete. </p>
