<h1>LAVIN</h1>
<p><small>(from Appendix N in <a href="../book">the main text</a>)</small></p>
<p>Thomas Lavin was born in County Mayo in 1877. He was but one of countess
  thousands who left that poverty stricken country for a hopefully better life 
  in England. His aspirations proved fruitful. He came to work for the Bradburns 
  on Layland Green Farm, at the corner of Layland Green Road and Ashton Road, 
  and somehow won the hand of the farmer's daughter Margaret. They married and 
  raised a family of nine children by operating a milk business. Harold, Margaret's 
  brother inherited the farm. Thomas died 10th February 1949 aged 72. His wife 
  Margaret died 13th May 1947 aged 68.</p>
<p>Thomas Lavin must have inspired his sons to get ahead in the world by his
  enterprise and adventurous spirt. Within one generation the family owned five 
  farms, an extensive coal delivery business and a productive coal mine. James 
  Lavin became a successful builder in his own right apart from getting into the 
  coal business with his brothers Fred, Lawrence and William. In 1942/43, when 
  Lord Gerard put up part of his estate for sale, he bought Garswood Hall Farm, 
  which is still in the family, run by his grandson Keith. Lawrence bought Senly 
  Green and Hollin Hey Farms, which are still in the family, run by his sons Norman 
  & Jeffrey. William bought Charity and Arch Lane Farms. He left them to his daughters 
  who sold them to the present owners. </p>
<p>James Lavin's first venture into the colliery business was not successful.
  His second attempt was however but part of the Bank's requirement was that his 
  brothers William, Frederick and Lawrence were part of the company. They started 
  what became know as Lavin's Pit before James took his family to Rhodesia 26th 
  March 1947. William Russell, a plumber from Moffat, shipped out for Africa on 
  the same vessel. He came to work for James Lavin when the latter started a building 
  business in Salisbury, Rhodesia, and eventually married James's daughter, Olive. 
  James made a coupe of trips home, buying Billinge Lane Farm in 1950, still farmed 
  by his son Reginald, before returning for good in 1952. The colliery continued 
  to function as an ongoing concern until 1970.</p>
